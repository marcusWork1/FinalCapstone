                        <p>In April 2023, six Tech Elevator Programmers were tired of 
                            bad movie recommendations that did not align with their interest.
                            Together they brainstromed and created an app that comes up with the best
                            movie to watch based on your personal preference and mood when trying to find
                            the perfect title to watch for date night. Our app follows a tinder-style 
                            format of clicking right or left on a movie if youâ€™ve seen it, and you rate how you felt about 
                            it the app would suggest movies based off of your swipes. 
                          </p>
